If this type of data is not available then I propose we can do the following for the baseline simulations:
	1.	Take cloudiness from ERA5  (the meteorological model used in the hydrodynamics)
	2.	Take wind speed from ERA5
	3.	For solar radiation we have two options:
		a.	Use the same as is used in the hydrodynamics (calculated based on latitude and cloudiness)
		b.	Assign a sinusoid per month such that the daily number of hours spent above 120W/m2 is equivalent to that year’s daily average for that month as per the BSH data you sent
	4.	For UV radiation we have three options
		a.	Use the data you sent directly as given
		b.	Assume a constant percentage of total visible light, which is taken from option 3a or 3b
		c.	Make a time series that is a synthesis of uv radiation regressed against cloudiness
